Journal Assignment
------------------

Throughout the course, students will keep a reading journal that examines the meanings of illness, the moral role of the physician, and the relevance of emotions, culture, faith, values, social realities, and life histories to patient care. This written work will be read and reviewed by the instructor, but it is confidential and will not be shared with the class.
